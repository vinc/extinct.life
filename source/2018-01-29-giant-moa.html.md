[Giant moa][1] (Dinornis) is an extinct genus of flightless birds belonging to
the moa family endemic to New Zealand. At the time they were the tallest birds
on the planet, reaching about 3.6 m in height with neck outstretched, and
weighting about 230 kg.

Before the arrival of human settlers, the moa's only predator was the massive
Haast's eagle. New Zealand had been isolated for 80 million years and had few
predators prior to human arrival, meaning that not only were its ecosystems
extremely fragile but the native species were ill-equipped to cope with human
predators.

The MƒÅori arrived sometime before 1300, and all moa genera were soon driven to
extinction by hunting and, to a lesser extent, by habitat reduction due to
forest clearance. By 1445, all moa had become extinct, along with the Haast's
eagle which had relied on them for food. Recent research suggests that the
events leading to extinction took less than a hundred years.
