[Red rails](/remember-lost-species/2018/01/22/red-rails/) (Aphanapteryx bonasia) is an extinct species of
flightless rail. It was endemic to the [Mascarene island](#) of Mauritius, east
of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean.

Human hunters took advantage of an attraction red rails had to red objects by
using coloured cloth to lure the birds so that they could be beaten with
sticks.

In addition to hunting pressure by humans, the fact that the red rail nested on
the ground made it vulnerable to pigs and other introduced animals, which ate
their eggs and young, probably contributing to its extinction.
