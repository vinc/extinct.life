The [Dodo](/remember-lost-species/2018/01/01/dodo/) (Raphus cucullatus) is an
extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of [Mauritius](#), east
of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean.

Like many animals that evolved in isolation from significant predators, the
dodo was entirely fearless of humans. This fearlessness and its inability to
fly made the dodo easy prey for sailors.

The human population on Mauritius never exceeded 50 people in the 17th century,
but they introduced other animals, including dogs, pigs, cats, rats, and
crab-eating macaques, which plundered dodo nests and competed for the limited
food resources. At the same time, humans destroyed the forest habitat of the
dodos. The impact of the introduced animals on the dodo population, especially
the pigs and macaques, is today considered more severe than that of hunting.
