The [Thylacine][1] (Thylacinus cynocephalus) was the largest known carnivorous
marsupial of modern times.  Native to continental Australia, [Tasmania][2] and
New Guinea, it is believed to have become extinct in the 20th century. It was
the last extant member of its family, Thylacinidae.

The thylacine had become extremely rare or extinct on the Australian mainland
before British settlement of the continent, but it survived on the island of
Tasmania along with several other endemic species, including the Tasmanian
devil. Intensive hunting encouraged by bounties is generally blamed for its
extinction, but other contributing factors may have been disease, the
introduction of dogs, and human encroachment into its habitat.
