The [pig-footed bandicoot][1] (Chaeropus ecaudatus) was a small marsupial of
the arid and semi-arid plains of Australia.

The cause of its extinction remains uncertain but the most likely explanation
is the introduction by Europeans of vast numbers of sheep and cattle, leading
to significant changes in soil structure, plant growth, and food availability.
