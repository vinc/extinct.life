The [Haast's eagle][1] (Harpagornis moorei) is an extinct species of eagle that
once lived in the [South Island][2] of New Zealand. It was the largest eagle
known to have existed. Its massive size is explained as an evolutionary
response to the size of its prey, the flightless [moa][3].

Haast's eagle became extinct around 1400, after the moa were hunted to
extinction by the first Maori.
