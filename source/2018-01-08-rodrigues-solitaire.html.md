The [Rodrigues solitaire](/2018/01/08/rodrigues-solitaire/) (Pezophaps solitaria) is an extinct, flightless bird that was endemic to the island of [Rodrigues](#), east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean.

The Rodrigues solitaire probably became extinct sometime between the 1730s and 1760s; the exact date is unknown. Its disappearance coincided with the tortoise trade between 1730 and 1750; traders burnt off vegetation, hunted solitaires and imported cats and pigs that preyed on eggs and chicks.
