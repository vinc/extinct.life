The [Rodrigues solitaire][1] (Pezophaps solitaria) is an extinct, flightless
bird that was endemic to the island of [Rodrigues][2], east of Madagascar in
the Indian Ocean. It was most closely related to the [dodo][3] of Mauritius.

The Rodrigues solitaire probably became extinct sometime between the 1730s and
1760s; the exact date is unknown. Its disappearance coincided with the tortoise
trade between 1730 and 1750; traders burnt off vegetation, hunted solitaires
and imported cats and pigs that preyed on eggs and chicks.
