[Newton's parakeet](/2018/01/15/newton-parakeet/)
(Psittacula exsul), also known as the Rodrigues parakeet or Rodrigues
ring-necked parakeet, is an extinct species of parrot that was endemic to the
Mascarene island of [Rodrigues](#) in the western Indian Ocean.

The bird became scarce due to deforestation and perhaps hunting, but it is
thought that it was finally wiped out by a series of cyclones and storms that
hit Rodrigues in the late 19th century.
